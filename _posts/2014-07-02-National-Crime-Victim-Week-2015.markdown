Each April, OVC (Office for Victim of Crime) helps lead communities throughout the country in their annual observances of [National Crime Victims’ Rights Week](http://ovc.ncjrs.gov/ncvrw/) by promoting victims’ rights and honoring crime victims and those who advocate on their behalf. In 2015, NCVRW will be observed April 19–25.  

OVC is now accepting nominations for the 2015 [National Crime Victims’ Service Awards](https://ovcncvrw.ncjrs.gov/awards/default.html). Recipients are honored at the National Crime Victims’ Service Awards Ceremony in Washington, D.C., in April. View past recipients and, if you know a similarly deserving individual, group, team, or program, submit a nomination by Wednesday, August 6, 2014.
