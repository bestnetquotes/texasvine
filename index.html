The transfer of data occurs every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. The telephone number is 1-877-894-8463.
</p>
<p>

A victim should not depend on the Texas VINE system or any other notification program if they feel like their safety may be threatened by the release of an inmate.

<h1>Register with VINE</h1>     
<h3>Anyone may call Texas VINE to determine the custody status of an offender.</h3>                   
<p>
There are two ways you can register to be notified by Texas VINE:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Call 1-877-894-8463&nbsp; (1-877-TX4-VINE)&nbsp; or TTY: (866) 847-1298
	<div class="serviceDescription">

	</div>
	</li>
	<li>Visit the VINELink website at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.vinelink.com" target="_blank">www.vinelink.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The inmate must be booked into the&nbsp;county jail before a victim can register for this service. After dialing the VINE number, follow the instructions given by the system. VINE will ask for a telephone number and a 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) to be used for notification calls. The PIN is used to verify a successful notification.
</p>
<p>
<br>
Information is transferred from participating county databases to the 
national VINE Operations Center every fifteen minutes. Registered users 
are then contacted by phone or email if there is a change in status.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
To search for information, callers will need to provide the system with one or more of the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Offender Name 
	</li>
	<li>Offender CID number 
	</li>
	<li>Date of Birth</li>
</ul>
<p>
Information provided when calling VINE service:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Name of Offender/Alias 
	</li>
	<li>CID Number 
	</li>
	<li>Date of Birth 
	</li>
	<li>Current Custody Status 
	</li>
	<li>Location of Offender</li>
</ul>
<h1>Notification</h1>
<p>
Notification calls begin as soon as the VINE Call Center receives updated records from the on-site computer.&nbsp; Notification calls to registered persons will be made when one or more of the following occur:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>General Release 
	</li>
	<li>Out of Custody 
	</li>
	<li>Escape 
	</li>
	<li>Transfer to Another Facility</li>
</ul>
<p>
Calls will be made every&nbsp;2 hours for 24 hours until the correct PIN is entered. Notifications messages will be left on an answering machine, but calls will continue for 24 hours until the correct PIN is entered. 
</p>
<p>
Telephone numbers are removed from the VINE database 14 days after release or transfer of the offender from the county facility.&nbsp;
