<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><strong><em>How 
the Law Works in Texas State</em></strong></font>
</p>
<strong>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><em>Adult 
Offenders </em></font>
</p>
</strong> 
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A 
law enforcement officer determines that there is a reasonable suspicion 
for an initial traffic stop of a motorist. After contact with the 
individual is initiated, the officer develops probable cause to 
arrest the person for DWI. Specifically, if the officer has reason 
to believe that the driver is impaired, a set of field sobriety 
tests may be administered. If the driver performs poorly, the driver 
is arrested for DWI and transported to the police station.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">At 
the station, the driver is asked to submit to a chemical test to 
measure his/her alcohol concentration. Usually, the individual is 
asked to take a breath test, although the officer may request a 
blood specimen. If the driver refuses to provide a specimen, or 
provides a specimen with a prohibited alcohol concentration, the 
officer serves the individual with a Notice of Suspension and confiscates 
the driver license.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><strong><em>Offenders 
Under 21 Years of Age </em></strong></font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">As 
with adult offenders, a law enforcement officer must have reasonable 
suspicion to conduct a traffic stop. However, a full custodial arrest 
is not required for a DUI offense, but is permitted, according to 
the officerâ€™s discretion. Once the officer determines that 
the individual is under 21 years of age, and has reason to believe 
that he/she has consumed alcohol, two distinct methods of enforcement 
are possible.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In
less serious cases, the officer will issue the driver a citation
for DUI, serve the individual with a Notice of Suspension
and confiscate the driver license. The minor will not be placed
under arrest and  no chemical test will be requested. Alternatively,
the officer may  proceed with a custodial arrest procedure if
he believes that the  individual is seriously impaired. Field
sobriety tests may be administered  and the minor will be arrested
(or taken into custody) and transported  to the police station.
The driver may be asked to submit to a chemical  test to measure
his/her alcohol concentration. If the minor refuses  to provide
a specimen or provides a specimen with any detectable  amount
of alcohol, the officer will issue a citation for DUI, serve
the individual with a Notice of Suspension and confiscate the
driver  license. Of course, the officer may arrest the minor
for the more  serious offense of DWI if the circumstances warrant
such a charge.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Regardless 
of age, the driver has 15 days from the date the Notice of Suspension 
is served to request a hearing. If no hearing is requested, the 
suspension automatically goes into effect on the 40th day after 
notice was served. If the individual requests a hearing, the temporary 
driving permit remains in effect until the date of the final decision 
of the administrative law judge. The driver is required to pay a 
fee of $125 to reinstate the license after the suspension period 
expires.</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><strong><em>Hearing 
Procedures </em></strong></font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 
ALR hearing is conducted at a location designated by SOAH in either 
the county of arrest (if the arrest occurred in a county with a 
population in excess of 300,000) or within 75 miles of the county 
seat of the county of arrest. Alternatively, both parties may agree 
to hold the hearing by teleconference. The hearing is conducted 
by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) employed by SOAH and the DPS 
has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. If the 
judge makes an affirmative finding on all the relevant issues, the 
license is suspended.</font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><strong><em>Adult 
Offenders</em></strong></font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If 
the driver failed the breath or blood test, the ALJ must determine 
whether (1) the person had an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater 
while operating a motor vehicle in a public place; and (2) reasonable 
suspicion to stop or probable cause to arrest the person existed.</font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If 
the driver refused to submit to a chemical test, the ALJ must determine 
whether (1) reasonable suspicion or probable cause existed to stop 
or arrest the person; (2) probable cause existed to believe that 
the person was operating a motor vehicle in a public place while 
intoxicated or operating a watercraft powered with an engine having 
a manufacturer's rating of 50 horsepower or more while intoxicated; 
(3) the person was placed under arrest by the officer and was requested 
to submit to the taking of a specimen; and (4) the person refused 
to submit to the taking of a specimen on request of the officer.</font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><strong><em>Offenders 
Under 21 Years of Age</em></strong></font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If 
a chemical test was not requested or if the driver provided a specimen 
with any detectable amount of alcohol, the ALJ must determine whether: 
(1) the person is a minor and had any detectable amount of alcohol 
in the minor's system while operating a motor vehicle in a public 
place; and (2) whether reasonable suspicion to stop or probable 
cause to arrest or take the minor into custody existed.</font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">If 
the driver refused to submit to a chemical test, the ALJ must determine 
whether; (1) reasonable suspicion or probable cause existed to arrest 
or take the minor into custody; (2) probable cause existed to believe 
that the minor was operating a motor vehicle in a public place while 
intoxicated or while having any detectable amount of alcohol in 
the minor's system or operating a watercraft powered with an engine 
having a manufacturer's rating of 50 horsepower or above while intoxicated; 
(3) the minor was placed under arrest or taken into custody and 
was requested to submit to the taking of a specimen; and (4) the 
minor refused to submit to the taking of a specimen on request of 
the officer.</font> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">An 
individual whose license has been suspended following an administrative 
hearing may appeal the decision rendered by the ALJ. The petition 
must be filed within thirty days of the decision in the county court 
in the county of arrest. A properly filed appeal petition stays 
the suspension for first offenders for up to ninety days.</font>
